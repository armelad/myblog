I've spent more than 15 years in  Information Technology Risk Management. I'm passionate about process improvement, innovative solutions and emerging technologies. I mostly focus on large corporate infrastructure,  technology/cyber governance, and operational risk management. My experience includes several years as an external consultant with  Big 4 (Ernst & Young).
